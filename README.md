# HawkEye

Project Description- Monitoring Dashboard, called HawkEye, allows you to monitor the operations of Vodafone-Idea sim cards real-time. It depicts information like Sim Activation Trends, Sim Recharge Trends, Sim Exchange Trends and Max Clients active on server, etc. It shows the live data of the operations being done every minute all over India.

Tech Stack: Developed micro-services using RESTful API and Spring Boot, in order to arrange the application as a collection of loosely coupled services that have completely independent life-cycles. Worked on MySQL and JDBC for maintaining and connecting large sets of data. Worked with Retrofit to deploy the micro-services onto the app. Built an Android app from scratch using various libraries for the analytics tool.
